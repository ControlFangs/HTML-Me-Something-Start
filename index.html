      I grew up with all sorts of videeo games.
      <p class="funParagraph">
         I remember my first sort of video game was a educational learning centered aroun blues clus if anyone remembers
         that.
         there were some other games to but they are way too far back to remember, but my first actual game was on the
         sega Dreamcast.
         if you have seen what I 3D modles you can probably guess what is.

            look if it wasn't for this game I would probably be doing some sort of sport,this game sparked my desier to
            do anything when it came to thee virtual world.
            as a kid it was the coolest thing ever, I loved the world the charechter the game play it was so cool to me.
            If i could expierience it for the first time again I would,
            the world was vibrant full of secrets and places to explore. Another thing was the muscic I could probably
            sing you word for word every song in that game, it was a staple of my child hood.

      This game is probably why im bad at any sort of fighting game im foucused on looking the coolest not really on how
      to fight some one.
      SSX was a snowboarding game that came laterin my life, I played it on the nintendo GameCube. I loved playing that
      game I would always try to get the besttrick score
      finding alternate routs to preform cooler tricks, unlock all the charecters and boards that went along with them.
      I loved that game one day I want to go snow boarding.

   My friend freinds actually got me into destiny I couldn't play with them because my family didn't have enough money
   for xbox live but i still played regardleses.
   It was the firs fps my parents let me play, I chose the hunter class because thats what my team needed. Bro bieng a
   hunder back in D1 was so cool,
   the arc sub class alowed you to crouch and go invisible for a brief poeriod of time it was so cool good times I had
   with that game.
